#Project Pseudo (v2)#

This is an old version of the game I am developing as it is still on my mind.
I've released this on Github to preserve the game in it's entirety, I don't really care what you do with this, go ham with it. As I'd love to see this version at least get some love, and I want to see people get creative with it.
